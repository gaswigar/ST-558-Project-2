The goal is to create models for predicting the shares variable from the dataset. You will create two models: a
linear regression model and a non-linear model (each of your choice). You will use the parameter functionality
of markdown to automatically generate an analysis report for each weekday_is_* variable (so you’ll end up
with seven total outputted documents).



```{r setup, include=FALSE,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
news<-read_csv("C:/Users/gswigart/Documents/NCSU/ST 558/Project 2/ST-558-Project-2/Data/OnlineNewsPopularity.csv")
```
Data
You should briefly describe the data and the variables you have to work with (no need to discuss all of them,
just the ones you want to use).
You should randomly sample from (say using sample()) the (Monday) data in order to form a training (70%
of the data) and test set (30% of the data). You should set the seed to make your work reproducible.




```{r}
names(news)
unique(news$weekday_is_monday)
news_monday<-news %>%
  filter(weekday_is_monday==1)

news_monday_train<-sample_n(news_monday,size=.7*nrow(news_monday))


```

Summarizations
You should produce some basic (but meaningful) summary statistics about the training data you are working
with. The general things that the plots describe should be explained but, since we are going to automate
things, there is no need to try and explain particular trends in the plots you see (unless you want to try and
automate that too!)


```{r}
ggplot(data=news_monday,aes(x=shares))+
  geom_density()

```

Modeling
Once you have your training data set, we are ready to fit some models.
You should fit two types of models to predict the shares. One model should be an ensemble model (bagged
trees, random forests, or boosted trees) and one should be a linear regression model (or collection of them
that you’ll choose from).

```{r}



```

The article referenced in the UCI website mentions that they made the problem into a binary classification
problem by dividing the shares into two groups (< 1400 and ≥ 1400), you can do this if you’d like or simply

try to predict the shares themselves.
Feel free to use code similar to the notes or use the caret package.

After training/tuning your two types of models (linear and non-linear) using cross-validation, AIC, or your
preferred method (all on the training data set only!) you should then compare them on the test set. Your
methodology for choosing your model during the training phase should be explained.


```{r}

```


Automation
Once you’ve completed the above for Monday, adapt the code so that you can use a parameter in your build
process that will cycle through the weekday_is_* variables.

```{r}

```
